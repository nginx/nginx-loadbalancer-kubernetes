## Welcome to the NGINX LoadBalancer for Kubernetes Solution

![Nginx K8s LB](docs/media/nlk-logo.png) | ![Nginx K8s LB](docs/media/nginx-2020.png)
--- | ---

This repo contains source code and documents for a `Kubernetes Controller from NGINX`, that provides TCP and HTTP load balancing external to a Kubernetes cluster. The primary supported use case is for NGINXaaS for Azure's [Load Balancer for Kubernetes](https://docs.nginx.com/nginxaas/azure/loadbalancer-kubernetes/), where users integrate an Azure Kubernetes Service service with an NGINXaaS deployment. It should also be possible to use this controller to integrate an on-prem Kubernetes cluster with one or many NGINX plus instances.

## Overview

- `NLK - NGINX Loadbalancer for Kubernetes` is a Kubernetes controller from NGINX that monitors specified Kubernetes services, and then sends API calls to an external NGINX Plus server to manage NGINX Upstream servers dynamically.
- This will `synchronize` the Kubernetes service's endpoints with the NGINX server's upstream list.
- One use case is to track the`NodePort` IP:Port definitions for the NGINX Ingress Controller's `nginx-ingress Service`.
- NLK is a native Kubernetes controller, running, configured and managed with standard Kubernetes commands.
- When NLK is paired with the NGINX Plus Server located external to the Kubernetes cluster, this controller will provide a `TCP Load Balancer Service` to the Kubernetes clusters.
- NLK paired with the NGINX Plus Server located external to the Cluster, using NGINX's advanced HTTP features, provides an `HTTP Load Balancer Service` for enterprise traffic management solutions, such as:
  - MultiCluster Active/Active Load Balancing
  - Horizontal Cluster Scaling
  - HTTP Split Clients - for A/B, Blue/Green, and Canary test and production traffic steering.  Allows Cluster operations/maintainence like upgrades, patching, expansion and troubleshooting with no downtime or reloads
  - Advanced TLS Processing - MutualTLS, OCSP, FIPS, dynamic cert loading
  - Advanced Security features - Oauth, JWT, App Protect WAF Firewall, Rate and Bandwidth limits
  - NGINX Java Script (NJS) for custom solutions
  - NGINX Zone Sync of KeyVal data
